India captain provided the star turn with the ball, and his captaincy, as his team defended 137.
It was 30 needed off 30 balls again and India still pulled it off and like at the T20 World Cup final a month ago, Suryakumar Yadav was one of their heroes. Only this time he did it as bowler of the 20th over, where he defended five runs by picking up two wickets.
Sri Lanka's batting has been extremely brittle in this T20I series. They collapsed three times in three games - 9 for 30, then 7 for 31 and finally 7 for 22. Tuesday's debacle would hurt particularly badly because they lost two wickets to Rinku Singh in the 19th over. He had only ever bowled 60 deliveries in his entire T20 career, which began way back in 2014. And two more wickets fell with the captain taking the ball. He'd only bowled twice in the last five years across first-class, List A and T20 cricket.
